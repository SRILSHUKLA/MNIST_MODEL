# MNIST Digit Classification with CNN and Flask

This project is a web application that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The app allows users to upload an image of a handwritten digit, and it predicts the digit while also visualizing the feature maps generated by the CNN.


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. The MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), is used to train the model. The trained model is then integrated into a Flask web application, where users can upload an image of a handwritten digit and get a prediction along with visualizations of the CNN's feature maps.

## How It Works

1. **Model Training**:
   - The CNN model is trained on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.
   - The model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, batch normalization, and dropout for regularization.
   - The model is saved as `best_model.keras` after training.

2. **Web Application**:
   - The Flask app loads the trained model and provides a user interface for uploading images.
   - When a user uploads an image, the app preprocesses it (resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization) and passes it through the CNN.
   - The app predicts the digit and generates visualizations of the feature maps from the convolutional layers.

3. **Feature Map Visualization**:
   - The app extracts feature maps from the convolutional layers of the model.
   - These feature maps are converted into base64-encoded images and displayed on the web page, giving users insight into how the CNN processes the input image.
